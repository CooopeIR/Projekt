# Introduction and Goals 

This section introduces The Weather Archive and explains underlying goals and requirements, which we pursue in the development of the new Weather Archive web applicaiton. 

### What is The Weather Archive

The Weather Archive is a platform for historical weather data. Having installed multiple cemeras across all european major cities, we want to provide historical weather data freely on the internet.
- Using our own API, we can provide high-resolution visual weather footage
- We pass metadata like humidity, air pressure at certain points in time


## Requirements Overview
Our target is to create a new web application, which displays historical weather data. These cameras take high-resolution pictures every five minutes, and we have to create an applicaiton, which 
- is accessible via browser across the entire world
- can scale with ease
- is reasonably performant in its response time (< 2 seconds)
- has below 0.5 % downtime each year
- is extensible and maintainable
- offers a good usability for website visitors
- use serverless technologies to minimize idle-costs

We aim to provide an application that is up to modern standards in visual as well as technical aspects, but also allows us to start small, and scale up to cover very high traffic loads.

| Id | Requirement | Explanation |
| ------- | ------- | ------- |
| F1 | Use loosely coupled microservices | As we aim to grow and potentially add new functionalities, we have to keep our system modular and extensible. Furthermore, there shall be minimum downtimes, which is why we need to decouple our functionalities as much as possible. |
| F2 | Worlwide availability | Our applicaition needs to be accessible to the biggestmost userbase possible. Anyone requiring european wether cam footage should be able to do, primarily via our web application. |
| F3 | Horizontal scalability | We need to be scalable in times of high demand, but also have to reduce idle costs, which is why we are going to use serverless functions inside our cloud infrstructure. |
| F4 | Response times below three seconds | Our weather cams provide high-resolution footage. Furthermore, we need to process video material to provide moving imagery, and we are going to use serverless functions to avoid idle costs. Still, our response times need to as low as possible. | 
| F4 | Visual usability assistance | Our users should be guided through the use of our web app. Thus, we have to keep to UX standards and aid them by useful features along their visits. | 
| F5 | Event-driven architecture | A lot of our backend processing can take place asynchronously, so we are able to reap the benefits of event-driven architectures. | 

## Quality Goals
The following table explains our three most important quality goals

| Id | Quality Goal | Explanation |
| ------- | ------- | ------- |
| QG1 | Maintainability | Our system may need to be modified in the future, so adding, modifying or improving system components based on changes in environemt or requirements needs to be easily doable. |
| QG2 | Reliability | Our system can handle a strongly varying number of traffic from across the globe. Errors within our system do not lead to total system outages, but rather only to outages of small system components. |
| QG3 | Operability | The system can be understood, learned, used and is attractive to our users. |

## Stakeholders
There are plenty of stakeholders, which hold some special interest in our system. The following section lists our main stakeholders and puts there interests in relation.

| Who | Interests |
| ------- | ------- |
| Software Architects | Require good understanding of software architecure, underlying thoughts and requirements as well as stakeholders. |
| Software Developers | Require an understanding of our system's software components and the overall system architecture. Are in need of a secure and modular environment, that makes adapting the sytem straightforward. |
| End users | Need ease of use when accessing our web application. The do not want to spend time learning how to achieve their desired task. Also, they want speedy performance, so as little loading time as possible. |
| DevOps Team | Want to have parts of the development process automated, in order to save time and improve efficiency. Want the software architecture to be modular and finegrained, in order to split up developers into smaller teams. They love the cloud. |
| Requirements Engineers | Need understanding of all stakeholders. Need clear documentations and require an understanding of system boundaries. |
| Meteorological Agencies | Want access to our data, in order to potentially use it for their own services. |


# Architecture Constraints
In order to achieve our quality goals and fulfill requirements, there are certain aspects that limit our freedom. These architectural constraints a listed below.

| Topic | Constraint |
|-----|------|
| Cloud Infrastructure | We need to use the cloud, which makes us prone to vendor lock-in. |
| High resolution imagery | As our images are very high resolution, we might need to vertically scale up, or downsize our instances, in order to quickly process these files. |
| Serverless functions | These functions can slow down our entire application, as they are required to cold-start frequently. |
| Data storage in serverless environments | We cannot store data well when working with serverless functions, as they are stateless, so we have to find a workaround for that. |
| Provider limitations | All limitations for concurrency, and lifetime configurations are limited to some degree by cloud providers, so we have to adhere to their limitations. |
| Costs | We can only afford so much infrastrucutre, so we have to make sure we do not exceed our budget when using auto-scaling features adn the like. |
| Data consistency | If we use caching mechanisms for performance benefits, we might suffer constraints regarding data consistency, so we have to take this into consideration. | 
| Data Privacy | Occasionally, there will be people walking around in our camera footage. We might have to take additional measures in order to blur faces, license plates and more. Also we have to consider which data will eventually end up in the cloud, and which GDPR / HIIPA constraints we therefore need to consider. |

# Context and Scope

The main players of our system are the system itself, which has an interface to its users on the one hand, and an interface to the weather cams on the other hand. Weather cams also receive information from our telemtetric sensors, so that we can add metadata about air pressure and such to our files. Also, system administrators have a special interface to our system, as they need to have priviledged access.

## Business Context
The diagram shows the main interfaces between our system and outside actors, such as users, admins and our weather cams, which are physically distributed across Europe. 
![Business Context Diagram](images/Business%20Context.drawio.png)

## Technical Context
In terms of technical interfaces, there are plenty of interfaces within our system. Users and Webcams all require the API, in order to reach the sysems internal functionalities. Our microservices, serverless functions, as well as our databases will have an interface to our API and event system.
